# Social Network API


The Social Network API is a backend technology that has been built to accomodate the core functions of a social media network. Become a user, make some friends, and post away!

## Description

The Social Media API is a NoSQL-based probram that uses MongoDB as well as Node and Express to bring you accurate API calls and ease of use. 

With thoughtful controllers to describe functionality:

and API routes to tie it all together.
